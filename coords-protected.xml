    This document describes developments in the 
    <code>grobCoords()</code> function in the R package 'grid', plus
    improvements to the 'gridGeometry' package that makes use of
    the <code>grobCoords()</code> function.
  </p>
  <p>
    These features are available in the development version of R 
    (to become 4.2.0) and in 'gridGeometry' version 0.3-0.
  </p>

  <toc/>

  <h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

  <p>
    The <code>grobCoords()</code> function (introduced in R version 3.6.0)
    generates a set of coordinates from a 'grid' grob.
    For example, the following code defines a 
    'grid' rectangle grob (and draws it) then calculates
    a set of coordinates
    from this rectangle grob (the vertices of the rectangle).
    The rectangle is centred 1 inch in from the 
    left of the image and 1 inch up form the bottom of the image
    and is 1 inch square, so the vertices are at
    (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 1.5), and (1.5, 0.5).

  <p>
    The 'gridGeometry' package (<a href="#pkg:gridGeometry"/>) 
    combines 'grid' grobs using
    operators like "union" and "intersection".  
    For example, in the following code we define a triangle shape 
    (and draw it) then we call <code>grid.polyclip()</code> from 'gridGeometry'
    to draw the union of the rectangle from above with this triangle.
  </p>
  <rcode><![CDATA[

  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode fig.width="2.5" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
triangle <- polygonGrob(c(1, 2, 2), c(1, 1.5, .5), default.units="in")
grid.draw(triangle)
  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode fig.width="2.5" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.polyclip(rectangle, triangle, "union")
  ]]></rcode>

  <p>
    The 'gridGeometry' package works by getting coordinates for each
    grob, via <code>grobCoords()</code>, and combining those coordinates
    using the 'polyclip' package (<a href="#pkg:polyclip"/>).
    Any changes to the <code>grobCoords()</code> function require changes to 
    the 'gridGeometry' package.
  </p>
  <p>
    The examples above are straightforward because, in the first 
    case, we calculated coordinates from a grob that draws a single
    shape, so the result was a single set of (x, y) coordinates.
    In the second case, we combined two grobs that both draw a
    single shape, so 'gridGeometry' only had to combine one shape
    with another.
  </p>
  <p>
    This report explores scenarios that are more complex, where
    we want to use <code>grobCoords()</code>
    to obtain the coordinates for a grob that draws more than one shape
    and where we want to use 'gridGeometry' to combine grobs that each
    draw more than one shape.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="grobCoords">Improving <code>grobCoords()</code></a></h2>

  <p>
    Before we consider more complex scenarios, we need to take a closer
    look at the coordinates generated for a grob that draws a single shape
    (shown again below).
  </p>
  <rcode><![CDATA[
coords
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    We have a single set of (x, y) coordinates (four points representing
    the vertices of the rectangle), but we can also see that those
    coordinates belong to "shape 1" and that shape belongs to "grob r".
    The "r" comes from the <code>name</code> argument that we 
    supplied in the original call to <code>rectGrob()</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This simple example demonstrates one of the changes to 
    <code>grobCoords()</code> in R 4.2.0:  the return value used to 
    be just a list of lists with components <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
    (a list of "xy-lists"),
    but now the return value is a
    "GridGrobCoords" object, with additional information (such as names),
    and a print method.
  </p>
  <rcode><![CDATA[
class(coords)
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    That additional information becomes more important when 
    we work with a grob that draws more than one shape.
    For example, the following code defines a grob that draws 
    two rectangles (and draws them) and then calculates the
    coordinates from that grob.  The result shows coordinates
    for two shapes, both of which belong to "grob r2".
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="3.5" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
rectangles <- rectGrob(c(1, 2.5), 1, 1, 1, default.units = "in", name = "r2")
grid.draw(rectangles)
  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode><![CDATA[
grobCoords(rectangles, closed = TRUE)
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    The following code demonstrates a different scenario.
    Here we define a path grob that consists of two rectangles,
    but the two rectangles together define a single shape;
    the inner rectangle creates a hole in the outer rectangle.
    There are two sets of (x, y) coordinates again, but this time
    they both belong to "shape 1".  We can also see that the 
    fill rule ("evenodd") has been recorded in the "GridGrobCoords"
    object.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
x <- c(.5, .5, 1.5, 1.5, .75, .75, 1.25, 1.25)
y <- c(.5, 1.5, 1.5, .5, .75, 1.25, 1.25, .75)
path <- pathGrob(x, y, 
                 id = rep(1:2, each=4), rule = "evenodd",
                 default.units = "in", name = "p",
                 gp = gpar(fill = "grey"))
grid.draw(path)
  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode><![CDATA[
grobCoords(path, closed = TRUE)
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    Of course, it is also possible to have a grob that describes
    multiple paths, each of which consists of multiple sets of 
    coordinates, as shown below.  In this case we have a path
    grob that describes two shapes, each of which consists of
    two rectangles, with an inner rectangle that creates a hole
    in an outer rectangle.  There are four sets of coordinates
    corresponding to the four rectangles, but two sets of coordinates
    belong to shape 1 and two sets of coordinates belong to shape 2.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="3.5" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
paths <- pathGrob(c(x, x + 1.5), c(y, y),
                  id = rep(rep(1:2, each=4), 2), 
                  pathId = rep(1:2, each=8), rule = "evenodd",
                  default.units = "in", name = "p2",
                  gp = gpar(fill = "grey"))
grid.draw(paths)
  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode><![CDATA[
grobCoords(paths, closed = TRUE)
  ]]></rcode>

  <p>
    We can add another level of complexity by considering 'grid' gTrees,
    which are collections of grobs.
    For example, the following code defines a gTree consisting
    of a rectangle and a path, draws the gTree, and calculates
    its coordinates.  The result has an extra level:
    one set of coordinates belongs to a "shape 1" that belongs
    to "grob r", two other sets of coordinates belong to a "shape 1"
    that belongs to "grob p3", and both "grob r" and "grob p3" 
    belong to "gTree parent".
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="3.5" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
path2 <- pathGrob(x + 1.5, y, 
                 id = rep(1:2, each=4), rule = "evenodd",
                 default.units = "in", name = "p3",
                 gp = gpar(fill = "grey"))
gt <- gTree(children=gList(rectangle, path2), name = "parent")
grid.draw(gt)
  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode fig.keep="none"><![CDATA[
grobCoords(gt, closed = TRUE)
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    We could keep going and add further layers, 
    because the children of a gTree can themselves
    be gTrees, but hopefully it is now clear how that would go.
    We will turn instead to an example of how the coordinates
    from <code>grobCoords()</code>
    can be used, by looking at the latest changes to the
    'gridGeometry' package.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="gridGeometry">Improving 'gridGeometry'</a></h2>
  
  <p>
    As we saw at the start, the 'gridGeometry' package can
    be used to combine grobs.  The following code shows another
    simple example where we create a new shape by subtracting a
    circle from a rectangle.  We first draw the two grobs 
    separately to show what they look like and then we draw the
    result of the rectangle "minus" the circle.  We fill the 
    result with grey to show that the circle has punched a hole
    in the rectangle.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
circle <- circleGrob(1, 1, r = .3, 
                     default.units = "in", gp=gpar(fill = NA))
grid.draw(rectangle)
grid.draw(circle)
  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.polyclip(rectangle, circle, "minus", 
              gp=gpar(fill = "grey"))
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    The following code demonstrates a more complex scenario with a 
    circle grob that draws three circles. 
    We first draw the circles on top of the rectangle to show the
    shapes that we are dealing with.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
circle <- circleGrob(c(.5, 1, 1.5), 1, r = .3, 
                     default.units = "in", gp=gpar(fill = NA))
grid.draw(rectangle)
grid.draw(circle)
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    When we subtract this circle
    grob from the rectangle grob, the result
    is obtained by first "reducing" the three circles to a single shape
    and then
    subtracting that result from the rectangle.      
    The result in this case is the rectangle with the three circles
    removed from it.  More accurately, the result is the
    rectangle with the <em>union</em> of the three circles 
    subtracted from it.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.polyclip(rectangle, circle, "minus", 
              gp=gpar(fill = "grey"))
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    When we give <code>grid.polyclip()</code> a grob that draws multiple shapes,
    the grob is first reduced to a single shape before being combined
    with the other argument.  
    By default, this reduction occurs by using <code>polyclip()</code>
    to combine the shapes using a "union" operator.
    In the example above, the three circles are reduced via "union" 
    to the single shape below.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2" echo="FALSE"><![CDATA[
grid.reduce(circle, "union")
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    There are two new arguments to <code>grid.polyclip()</code>, 
    <code>reduceA</code> and <code>reduceB</code>, which
    can be used to control how multiple shapes are reduced to a single shape.
    For example, the following code reduces the three circles
    using "xor" before subtracting them from the rectangle.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.polyclip(rectangle, circle, "minus", reduceB = "xor", 
              gp=gpar(fill = "grey"))
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    There is also a new function, <code>grid.reduce()</code>, that just performs
    this grob reduction.  This function
    takes a grob and reduces it a new grob that describes a single
    shape (either a path or a line).
    For example, the following code reduces the grob that
    draws three circles into a single shape using "xor".
    The grey filled area below is the shape that was subtracted from
    the rectangle to produce the <code>grid.polyclip()</code> 
    result above.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.reduce(circle, "xor", gp=gpar(fill="grey"))
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    In the more complex example above, only the second argument
    to <code>grid.polyclip()</code> was a grob that
    draws more than one shape.  It is also possible for the 
    first argument to <code>grid.polyclip()</code> to be a grob that draws
    more than one shape and it is possible for either or both arguments
    to be gTrees.
    In the case of gTrees, each child grob is reduced 
    and then all of the reduced children are reduced together.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following example provides a demonstration of collapsing a more
    complex grob.  For this example, we will work with the SVG 
    version of the R logo (shown below).
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="Rlogo.svg" width="200" alt="The R logo"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    The following code uses the 'grImport2' package 
    (<a href="#pkg:grImport2"/>) to
    import the R logo into a 'grid' gTree.
    We create a gTree that will just draw the outlines
    of the imported logo and fill it with a semitrasparent grey.
    The 'rsvg' package 
    (<a href="#pkg:rsvg"/>) is used to convert the original SVG logo
    into a Cairo graphics version in preparation for import.
  </p>
  <rcode message="FALSE"><![CDATA[
library(rsvg)
rsvg_svg("Rlogo.svg", "Rlogo-cairo.svg")
library(grImport2)
Rlogo <- readPicture("Rlogo-cairo.svg")
semigrey <- rgb(.5, .5, .5, .5)
logoGrob <- pictureGrob(Rlogo, 
                        gpFUN = function(gp) gpar(col="black", fill=semigrey))
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    The resulting gTree contains another gTree, which contains 
    two further gTrees ("picComplexPath" gTrees), each of which contains 
    two grobs (a "picPath" grob and a "picPolyline" grob).
  </p>
  <rcode><![CDATA[
grid.ls(logoGrob)
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    Drawing the logo shows that there are two main shapes in the logo,
    the "R" itself and the ellipse that encircles the top of the "R"
    and that both of those shapes consist of two curves with the 
    inner curve creating a hole in the outer curve.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.draw(logoGrob)
  ]]></rcode>

  <p>
    The following code calls <code>xyListFromGrob()</code> to convert
    that complicated gTree to a single shape using the default 
    "union" operator).  This forms the union of the "R" shape with the ellipse
    shape.
    We then convert the result back to a path grob with
    <code>xyListToPath()</code> 
    and draw it.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.reduce(logoGrob, gp=gpar(fill="grey"))
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    The following code "xor"s the R logo gTree
    with the rectangle that we used in
    previous examples.  This implicitly performs the reduction of
    the R logo (that we just did explicitly)
    before subtracting it from the rectangle.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.polyclip(rectangle, logoGrob, "xor", gp=gpar(fill="grey"))
  ]]></rcode>


  <h3>Combining "open" shapes</h3>
  <p>
    All of the examples so far have involved "closed" shapes - shapes
    that have an interior that can be filled, like polygons and paths.
    It is also possible for the <code>A</code> argument to 
    <code>grid.polyclip()</code> to be an "open" shape, like a line
    segment or a Bezier curve.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following code demonstrates a simple example where we subtract
    a single circle from a single line segment.  As before, we first
    draw both shapes separately and then we draw the result
    of <code>grid.polyclip()</code>.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
line <- segmentsGrob()
circle <- circleGrob(1, 1, r = .3, 
                     default.units = "in", gp=gpar(fill = NA))
grid.draw(circle)
grid.draw(line)
  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.polyclip(line, circle, "minus")
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    The next example shows what
    happens when we have multiple shapes from an open grob.
    In this case we have a segments grob that draws two lines
    that criss-cross each other and we are subtracting a single circle.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
lines <- segmentsGrob(0:1, 0, 1:0, 1)
circle <- circleGrob(1, 1, r = .3, 
                     default.units = "in", gp=gpar(fill = NA))
grid.draw(circle)
grid.draw(lines)
  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.polyclip(lines, circle, "minus")
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    Although that result may be what we expected, it hides a 
    detail about how the <code>A</code> argument is reduced.
    This result does <em>not</em> come from reducing
    the two line segments with a "union" operator
    (the default that we saw happening for the <code>B</code> argument
    in previous examples).  If we try to take the <em>union</em> of two
    open shapes, the result is empty, as shown below.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.reduce(lines, "union")
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    When the <code>A</code> argument is open, by default, it is 
    reduced using the "flatten" operator rather than the "union"
    operator, which is the default for closed shapes.
    The "flatten" operator just combines
    all of the open shapes into a single grob.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.reduce(lines)
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    The "flatten" operator can also be used for the <code>B</code> argument
    and for open shapes.  The following code provides a simple
    demonstration.  The segments grob is the same as in the last example,
    but we subtract a circle grob that draws two circles.
    We specify <code>reduceB = "flatten"</code> so that the two circles
    are reduced to a list of two sets of coordinates (one for each circle)
    and we specify
    <code>fillB = "evenodd"</code> so that the flattened circles
    are interpreted using an even-odd fill rule (so the inner circle
    creates a hole in the outer circle).  The result is that
    we subtract a donut from the two line segments.
  </p>

    <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
lines <- segmentsGrob(0:1, 0, 1:0, 1)
circle <- circleGrob(1, 1, r = c(.3, .1), 
                     default.units = "in", gp=gpar(fill = NA))
grid.draw(circle)
grid.draw(lines)
  ]]></rcode>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.polyclip(lines, circle, "minus", reduceB = "flatten", fillB = "evenodd")
  ]]></rcode>

  <h3>The <code>trim()</code> function</h3>
  <p>
    The 'gridGeometry' package also has a <code>trim()</code> function
    for extracting subsets of open shapes.  For example,
    the following code extracts a subset of a line segment starting
    from .2 of the distance along the segment at ending at 
    halfway along the line segment.  The original line is drawn
    in grey and the subset is drawn in (thick) black.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
line <- segmentsGrob(.2 ,.2, .8, .8, gp=gpar(lwd=2, col="grey"))
grid.draw(line)
grid.trim(line, .2, .5, gp=gpar(lwd=5))
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    The <code>grid.trim()</code> function has also been updated
    to handle grobs that draw more than one shape:
    all shapes are trimmed using the same set of <code>from</code>
    and <code>to</code> arguments.  For example, the following
    code trims a segments grob that draws two line segments,
    using the same <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> 
    as in the previous example.
  </p>

    The following code shows a more complex example where we trim
    a gTree that has the segments grob as its child, plus a circle
    grob, plus another gTree that has two lines grobs as its children.
    Again, all children are trimmed using the same set of 
    <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> arguments.
    This also shows that closed shapes, like the circle, produce
    no output when trimmed. Only the open shapes are include in the
    result.

  <h2><a name="gridinternals">More information about the changes to <code>grobCoords()</code></a></h2>

  <p>
    The main change to the 'grid' functions <code>grobCoords()</code> 
    and <code>grobPoints()</code> is that they now return more complex 
    values.  This section describes the format of those data structures
    for anyone who wants to write code that either generates or
    consumes these new values.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are three new classes of object:  
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        "GridCoords" is a list with numeric components <code>x</code>
        and <code>y</code>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This represents a set of coordinates that describe a simple shape
        or part of a more complex shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        A "GridCoords" object can be generated with the 
        <code>gridCoords()</code> function, which takes <code>x</code>
        and <code>y</code> as arguments.
      </p>
      <rcode><![CDATA[
gc <- gridCoords(x=1:4, y=4:1)
gc
      ]]></rcode>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        "GridGrobCoords" is a list of one or more "GridCoords".        
      </p>
      <p>
        This represents the shapes that are described by a 'grid' grob.
      </p>
      <p>
        The list can have names to indicate which "GridCoords" belong
        to the same shape (e.g., a single path consisting of two concentric
        circles).  
        The list also has a <code>"name"</code> attribute and 
        may have a <code>rule</code> attribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        A "GridGrobCoords" object can be generated with the
        <code>gridGrobCoords()</code> function, which takes a
        list of "GridCoords" and a <code>name</code> argument
        and an optional <code>rule</code> argument.
      </p>
      <rcode><![CDATA[
ggc <- gridGrobCoords(list("1"=gc), name="A")
ggc
      ]]></rcode>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        "GridGTreeCoords" is a list of one or more "GridGrobCoords" or
        "GridGTreeCoords".
      </p>
      <p>
        This represents the shapes that are described by a 'grid' gTree.
      </p>
      <p>
        The list has a <code>"name"</code> attribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        A "GridGTreeCoords" object can be generated with the
        <code>GridGTreeCoords()</code> function, which takes a
        list of "GridGrobCoords" or "GridGTreeCoords" objects
        and a <code>name</code> argument.
      </p>
      <rcode><![CDATA[
ggtc <- gridGTreeCoords(list(ggc), name="B")
ggtc
ggtc2 <- gridGTreeCoords(list(ggtc, ggc), name="C")
ggtc2
      ]]></rcode>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The reason for introducing these more complex structures is that
    more information about the original grob or gTree is retained
    in the <code>grobCoords()</code> result.  This makes it possible
    to identify which coordinates correspond to which shape within
    the grob or gTree.  The <a href="#discussion"/> 
    mentions one example where this used within 'grid' itself
    (to resolve pattern fills).
  </p>

  <h2><a name="gridgeometryinternals">More information about the changes to 'gridGeometry'</a></h2>

  <p>
    The 'gridGeometry' package provides an interface between the 'grid'
    package and the 'polyclip' package.   This requires converting
    from a 'grid' grob
    to a list of xy-lists that the 'polyclip' package can work with (and
    back again).
  </p>
  <p>
    In R versions prior to 4.2.0, the <code>grobCoords()</code> function
    generated a list of xy-lists as its output, so 
    the result from <code>grobCoords()</code> could be fed
    directly to functions in the 'polyclip' package.
    From R 4.2.0, the result from <code>grobCoords()</code> is more complex,
    so 'gridGeometry' has some additional functions to 
    to convert <code>grobCoords()</code> output to a list of xy-lists.
  </p>
  <p>
    <!-- pdflatex diagram.tex; convert diagram.pdf diagram.png -->
    <img src="diagram.png"/>
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>grid.polyclip()</code> function and the
    <code>grid.reduce()</code> function accept 'grid' grobs
    and return 'grid' grobs.  This is the simplest user interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>xyListFromGrob()</code> function converts a grob
    into a list of xy-lists.  It first converts a grob
    to a "GridGrobCoords" (or "GridGTreeCoords") object using 
    <code>grobCoords()</code>.
    The "GridGrobCoords" (or "GridGTreeCoords") object is then
    reduced to a list of xy-lists either by "flatten"ing all of the
    "GridCoords" from the grob to a single list or by 
    combining shapes (one or more "GridCoords" from the same grob)
    using <code>polyclip::polyclip()</code> and the operator specified
    in <code>reduceA</code> or <code>reduceB</code>.
    A gTree reduces each of its  children and then combines the
    reduced children together.
    This function provides another way to enter the 'polyclip'
    world, starting from a 'grid' grob.
  </p>
  <p>
    The functions <code>xyListToPath()</code>, 
    <code>xyListtoPolygon()</code>, and
    <code>xyListToLine()</code> convert back from a list of xy-lists to a grob.
    There may be more than one xy-list, in which case, 
    <code>xyListToPolygon()</code> creates a grob that draws a 
    separate polygon for each xy-list,
    <code>xyListToPath()</code> creates a grob that draws a single
    path (using <code>rule</code> to determine the interior of the path),
    and <code>xyListToLine()</code> creates a grob that draws a separate line
    for each xy-list.
    These functions allow the user to return from the 'polyclip'
    world back to the world of 'grid' grobs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>polyclip()</code> function takes 
    a list of xy-lists and returns a list of xy-lists.
    This allows the user to perform calculations in the 'polyclip'
    world.  For example, we can use <code>xyListFromGrob()</code> to
    generate coordinates from a closed 'grid'
    grob, but then work with them as if they are coordinates from an
    open shape.
  </p>
  <h3>Fill rules</h3>
  <p>
    When a list of xy-lists is fed to <code>polyclip::polyclip()</code>,
    a fill rule is specified to determine the interior of the shape
    that is described by the list of xy-lists.
    When we convert a grob to a list of xy-lists, the fill rule may
    be included in the <code>grobCoords()</code> result (e.g.,
    if we are converting a path grob), but it may not.
    The fill rule that gets sent to <code>polyclip::polyclip()</code>
    is determined as follows:  if the user specifies 
    <code>fillA</code> or <code>fillB</code> explicitly, that fill
    rule is used;  otherwise, if the <code>grobCoords()</code> result
    contains a fill rule, that is used;  otherwise the fill rule is
    "nonzero" (the 'polyclip' way of saying "winding").
    Note that this is different from the default of "evenodd" that
    <code>polyclip::polyclip()</code> itself uses.
  </p>
  <h3>Combinations of open and closed shapes</h3>
  <p>
    The <code>grobCoords()</code> function has a <code>closed</code>
    argument to indicate whether we want the coordinates of a closed
    shape or an open shape.  
    From R 4.3.0, and in 'gridGeometry' >= 0.3-1, where it can
    be determined that the grob is open, <code>closed</code> defaults
    to <code>FALSE</code>.  Otherwise, <code>closed</code> defaults
    to <code>TRUE</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we ask for the coordinates from a polygon grob,
    we get the coordinates of the polygon if <code>closed=TRUE</code>, but
    we get nothing ("empty" coordinates) if <code>closed=FALSE</code>.
    Similarly, if we ask for the coordinates from a line grob,
    we get the coordinates of the line if <code>closed=FALSE</code>, but
    we get nothing if <code>closed=TRUE</code>.    
    A gTree presents a problem because it can contain grobs that draw
    both open and closed shapes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The <code>grid.polyclip()</code> function handles this problem 
    by generating open coordinates for <code>A</code> 
    and combining them with <code>B</code>
    and then also generating closed coordinates
    for <code>A</code> 
    and combining them with <code>B</code>.  
    The final result is then a gTree that
    combines the open result and the closed result.
  </p>
  <p>
    The following code shows an example where <code>A</code> is a 
    gTree consisting of a line and a rectangle and <code>B</code>
    is a circle grob (and the operator is "minus").  
    The result is a combination of the (closed)
    rectangle minus the (closed) circle and the (open) line
    minus the (closed) circle.
  </p>
  <rcode fig.width="2" fig.height="2"><![CDATA[
grid.polyclip(gTree(children=gList(rectGrob(width=.5, height=.5),
                                   segmentsGrob(0, .5, 1, .5))),
              circleGrob(r=.2),
              "minus",
              gp=gpar(fill="grey"))
  ]]></rcode>
  <p>
    Note that <code>B</code> cannot be open, 
    a <a href="http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper/documentation/Docs/Units/ClipperLib/Classes/ClipperBase/Methods/AddPaths.htm">limitation imposed by the underlying 
    Clipper library</a> (<a href="#clipper"/>).
    On the other hand, the Clipper library does allow <code>A</code>
    to be a combination of open and closed shapes 
    (though <a href="http://www.angusj.com/delphi/clipper/documentation/Docs/Units/ClipperLib/Types/ClipType.htm">the semantics of that can be tortuous</a>),
    whereas 'gridGeometry' only ever calls <code>polyclip::polyclip()</code>
    with either <code>A</code> entirely closed or
    <code>A</code> entirely open.
  </p>

  <h3>To reduce or not to reduce</h3>
  <p>
    Another question is whether, although we have to do some reducing for
    complex grobCoords() results (e.g., from a gTree), 
    do we need to reduce coords from simple
    collections of shapes, e.g., 
    a rect grob that draws multiple shapes?  
    'polyclip' (and the Clipper
    library) can handle a list of xy-lists.
    The answer to that is that we CAN simply pass through a list 
    of xy-lists (one per shape) by specifying op="flatten" !
    That is not the *default* value for closed shapes, but we
    can explicitly specify it if we want to!
    NOTE that if we pass the list of xy-lists to 'polyclip',
    we still have to give it a fill rule, AND then we have to 
    provide a fill rule when turning the result back into a grob.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="discussion">Discussion</a></h2>
  <p>
    The main idea behind the changes to grobCoords is to
    provide more detailed and comprehensive information
    about the coordinates for a 'grid' grob.
    We want to retain information about where the sets of 
    coordinates came from through both a hierarchical structure
    and labelling of components within that structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The 'gridGeometry' package makes some use of that extra information,
    e.g., to determine the fill rule that it sends to 'polyclip' functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The grobCoords() function is also
    used by 'grid' itself for resolving fill patterns
    (by making use of the names on <code>grobCoords()</code> output),
    as described in the vecpat tech report.
    Here the extra information is important because it allows
    us to resolve a pattern relative to individual shapes within a grob
    as well as relative to the bounding box around all shapes within a
    grob.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also hoped that the extra information may prove useful to 
    code writers and package developers that make use of 
    <code>grobCoords()</code> output.
